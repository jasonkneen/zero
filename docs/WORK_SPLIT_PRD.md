# Zero WorkSplit PRD v2: Balanced And Conflict-Free Team Plan

Status: Draft v2.0
Date: 2026-06-02
Timeline: 6 months to v1.0
Team: Vasanth, Gnanam, Anandan

This v2 replaces the conflict points in the original WorkSplit PRD:

- UI/TUI surfaces are separated from backend capabilities.
- Headless `exec` is split into CLI surface, runtime protocol, and distribution responsibilities.
- Search is scheduled after a minimal session event store exists.
- Slash commands are split into command UI, backend APIs, and integration commands.
- Anandan's workload is narrowed to infra/distribution/integrations, with clear dependencies on Gnanam runtime contracts.
- Each milestone gives all 3 people similar effort and reviewable PR slices.

## Product Goal

Zero is a production coding agent CLI/TUI that can:

- Chat and stream responses in a polished terminal UI.
- Read, write, edit, search, and run tools safely.
- Use OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and Gemini providers.
- Track context and cost.
- Run headless for scripts, automation, CI, and VS Code.
- Persist, resume, fork, search, and export sessions.
- Connect to MCP servers and load local plugins.
- Run tests, manage git, self-verify changes, and operate inside sandbox policies.

## Ownership Rules

These rules prevent future conflicts:

1. Every feature has one Directly Responsible Owner.
2. UI/TUI commands and backend modules are separate deliverables.
3. Cross-owner features must land the backend contract before UI/integration work depends on it.
4. Provider-specific logic stays inside provider modules.
5. Session/event protocol is owned by Gnanam and consumed by TUI, VS Code, MCP, and automation.
6. Distribution work packages stable behavior; it does not define runtime semantics.
7. Permission prompts are Vasanth's UI, but grants/policy/sandbox enforcement are Gnanam's backend.
8. Windows platform implementation is Anandan's, but it must use the shared sandbox policy interface.

## Team Roles

| Person | Primary role | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vasanth | Product lead, TUI, tools UX | Ink TUI, slash command UI, tool result rendering, local tool UX, permission prompts, themes, command palette, user-facing flows | Provider internals, session protocol, MCP transports, release pipeline |
| Gnanam | Runtime backend, providers, protocols | Model registry, provider factory, Anthropic/Gemini, usage/cost, session store, stream-json, config validation, doctor/search backend, MCP/plugin backend, permissions/grants, sandbox policy | TUI rendering, binary packaging, VS Code extension UI |
| Anandan | Infra, distribution, external integrations | CI, build, single binary, release packages, installers, self-update, performance benchmarks, VS Code extension, GitHub PR integration, Windows sandbox, release security | Provider internals, TUI command rendering, model registry |

## Shared Contracts

These contracts are required before dependent work starts:

| Contract | Owner | Consumers | Needed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provider stream event schema | Gnanam | Vasanth, Anandan | TUI streaming, headless output, VS Code |
| Model registry API | Gnanam | Vasanth | `/model`, `/effort`, cost, context budget |
| Session event schema | Gnanam | Vasanth, Anandan | `/resume`, `/rewind`, search, VS Code, audit |
| Command registry shape | Vasanth | Gnanam, Anandan | Slash command registration and help |
| Build/test scripts | Anandan | Vasanth, Gnanam | CI, DoD, release |
| Permission/grant policy | Gnanam | Vasanth, Anandan | prompts, MCP permissions, sandbox, Windows |
| Stream-json protocol | Gnanam | Anandan | VS Code extension and automation |

## Slash Command Ownership Matrix

| Command | UI owner | Backend owner | Fully done by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/clear` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M2 | New session/reset event. |
| `/compact` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M2 | Requires token/cost/context backend. |
| `/context` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M2 | Registry + usage + tool/MCP context. |
| `/rewind` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M3 | Requires durable event store. |
| `/resume` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M3 | M2 can list minimal sessions; M3 full resume/fork. |
| `/exit` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M2 | Must flush session-end event. |
| `/model` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M1/M2 | Registry lands M1, UI polished M2. |
| `/effort` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M1/M2 | Reasoning metadata from registry. |
| `/style` | Vasanth | Vasanth | M2 | UI/config preference only unless style affects prompts. |
| `/permissions` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M4/M6 | MCP permissions in M4, sandbox grants in M6. |
| `/init` | Vasanth | Vasanth | M4 | Project memory scaffold. |
| `/memory` | Vasanth | Vasanth | M4 | Memory inspect/reload. |
| `/skills` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M4 | UI by Vasanth; plugin-provided skills backend by Gnanam. |
| `/mcp` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M4 | MCP client/server/backend by Gnanam. |

| `/doctor` | Vasanth | Gnanam | M2 | Backend CLI and TUI share same checks. |
| `/feedback` | Vasanth | Anandan | M3/M5 | Redaction by Gnanam; GitHub/product integration by Anandan. |

## Headless Exec Ownership

Headless `exec` is split to avoid conflict:

| Area | Owner | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| CLI command and flags | Vasanth | `zero exec`, `--model`, `--output-format`, help text, exit message display. |
| Runtime execution | Gnanam | Provider factory, stream events, usage, tool loop hooks, session recording, stream-json. |
| Packaging and CI | Anandan | Binary command works across platforms, CI tests headless modes, release artifacts. |

## Permission Ownership

| Area | Owner | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt UI | Vasanth | Allow/deny/always controls and TUI display. |
| Policy engine | Gnanam | Risk classification, grants, persistent decisions, MCP permissions, sandbox policy. |
| Platform adapters | Gnanam + Anandan | Gnanam owns Linux/macOS; Anandan owns Windows using same policy. |

## Definition Of Done Per PR

Every PR must include:

- Tests for changed behavior.
- `bun test` passes.
- `bun run typecheck` passes.
- `bun run build` passes or the PR explicitly documents why build is not applicable.
- PR description explains what changed and why.
- No unrelated refactors.
- Redaction used for secrets in logs/errors/tests.
- Cross-owner API changes include a small contract note or test.

## Review Rotation

| Author | Primary reviewer | Secondary reviewer when cross-owner |
|---|---|---|
| Vasanth | Gnanam | Anandan for distribution/VS Code impact |
| Gnanam | Anandan | Vasanth for TUI/UX impact |
| Anandan | Vasanth | Gnanam for runtime/protocol impact |

## Balanced Workload Summary

| Milestone | Vasanth load | Gnanam load | Anandan load |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Core tools + TUI baseline | Runtime contracts | Scripts + CI baseline |
| M1 | Model/headless UI | Registry + providers | CI + binary + packaging |
| M2 | Core slash UX + compaction UI | Cost + doctor + search + events | Install + update + perf |
| M3 | Session UI + themes | Sessions + stream-json | VS Code + docs + Homebrew |
| M4 | Extensibility UI | MCP + plugins + permissions | Subagents + agent docs |
| M5 | Verification/web UX | Git + tests + self-verify | GitHub review automation |
| M6 | Security UX | Linux/macOS sandbox + grants | Windows sandbox + release security |

This keeps workload balanced while preserving clean ownership boundaries.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Merge or close PR #6 with M0 baseline decision.
2. Anandan adds/validates project scripts and CI baseline if missing.
3. Gnanam starts `feat/m1-model-registry`.
4. Vasanth starts model selector UI only after registry API shape is agreed.
5. Gnanam starts provider factory before Anthropic/Gemini providers.
6. Anandan starts CI matrix and binary build spike in parallel.
